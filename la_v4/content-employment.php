                            <p>
                                I have worked on the main Olympics London 2012 website for more than 5 years before
                                the actual Olympics in 2012. <br/><br/>

                                My job was to taking care of the all the HTML &amp; CSS, setting up micro-sites, implementing and testing / fixing new front-end features to
                                the highest usablility standards possible. <br/><br/>
                                The website received more than 20 million hits one year, makeing it a personal Milestone for me and the company I worked at at the time.
