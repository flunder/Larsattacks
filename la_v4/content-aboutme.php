            <h2>What I do</h2>

            <p>
                I aim to write the most beautiful code possible. My HTML5 is validated and
                search engine optimized, WordPress sites are easily updatable and everything
                is beautifully responsive. Work is always delivered on-time or ahead of
                schedule and it's my job to ensure you never have to deal with ugly old code
                ever again.
