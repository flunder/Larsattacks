            <h2>Personal Ventures</h2>

            <p>
                Some of my personal ventures created out of testing out ideas,
                trying to learn things or just for fun.

                        <h3>Bikeshd</h3>

                        <p>
                            originally came to fruition to keep owners of stolen bikes in
                            the loop about bikes being shifted through Gumtree and Ebay.
                            Great idea, great purpose. But it serves a great double
                            application—it also serves as a nifty filter when you.
