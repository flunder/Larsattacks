                Some of my personal ventures created out of testing out ideas,
                trying to learn things or just for fun.

                            originally came to fruition to keep owners of stolen bikes in
                            the loop about bikes being shifted through Gumtree and Ebay.
                            Great idea, great purpose. But it serves a great double
                            application—it also serves as a nifty filter when you.
